ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. However, it is vital to understand the right way to ask ChatGPT in order to get the high-quality outputs we desire.\nI have used simple language with on-point practical explanations, together with examples and prompt formulas on every prompt technique. With this book, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to use prompt engineering techniques to control the output of ChatGPT and generate text that is tailored to your specific needs.\nThroughout this book, we also provide examples of how to combine different prompt techniques to achieve more specific outcomes.\nChapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering Techniques What is Prompt engineering?\nPrompt engineering is the process of creating prompts or asking or instructions that guide the output of a language model like ChatGPT. It allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is tailored to their specific needs.\nChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. It is built on the transformer architecture, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and generate highquality text.\nHowever, in order to get the best results from ChatGPT, it is important to understand how to properly prompt the model.\nPrompting allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is relevant, accurate, and of high-quality.\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it is important to understand its capabilities and limitations.\nThe model is capable of generating human-like text, but it may not always produce the desired output without proper guidance.\nThis is where prompt engineering comes in, by providing clear and specific instructions, you can guide the model\u0026rsquo;s output and ensure that it is relevant.\nPrompt Formula A prompt formula is a specific format for the prompt, it is generally composed of 3 main elements:\ntask: a clear and concise statement of what the prompt is asking the model to generate. instructions: the instructions that should be followed by the model when generating text. role: the role that the model should take on when generating text. In this book, we will explore the various prompt engineering techniques that can be used with ChatGPT. We will discuss the different types of prompts, as well as how to use them to achieve specific goals you want.\nChapter 2: Instructions Prompt Technique The instructions prompt technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing specific instructions for the model to follow.\nThis technique is useful for ensuring that the output is relevant and high-quality.\nTo use the instructions prompt technique, you will need to provide a clear and concise task for the model, as well as specific instructions for the model to follow.\nFor example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a task such as \u0026ldquo;generate responses to customer inquiries\u0026rdquo; and instructions such as \u0026ldquo;responses should be professional and provide accurate information\u0026rdquo;.\nPrompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate [task] following these instructions: [instructions]\u0026rdquo;\nExamples\nGenerating customer service responses: Task: Generate responses to customer inquiries Instructions: The responses should be professional and provide accurate information Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate professional and accurate responses to customer inquiries following these instructions: The responses should be professional and provide accurate information.\u0026rdquo; Generating a legal document: Task: Generate a legal document Instructions: The document should be in compliance with relevant laws and regulations Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a legal document that is compliant with relevant laws and regulations following these instructions: The document should be in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\u0026rdquo; When using the instructions prompt technique, it is important to keep in mind that the instructions should be clear and specific. This will help to ensure that the output is relevant and high-quality.\nThe instructions prompt technique can be combined together with “role prompting” and “seed-word prompting” as explained in the next chapter to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\nChapter 3: Role Prompting The role prompting technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific role for the model to take on.\nThis technique is useful for generating text that is tailored to a specific context or audience.\nTo use the role prompting technique, you will need to provide a clear and specific role for the model to take on. For example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a role such as \u0026ldquo;customer service representative\u0026rdquo;.\nPrompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate [task] as a [role]\u0026rdquo;\nExamples\nGenerating customer service responses: Task: Generate responses to customer inquiries Role: Customer service representative Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate responses to customer inquiries as a customer service representative.\u0026rdquo; Generating a legal document: Task: Generate a legal document Role: Lawyer Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a legal document as a lawyer.\u0026rdquo; Using the role prompting technique with instruction prompting and seed-word prompting will enhance the output of ChatGPT.\nInstruction prompting, Role prompting, and Seed-word prompting techniques combined: Task: Generate a product description for a new smartphone Instructions: The description should be informative, persuasive and highlight the unique features of the smartphone Role: Marketing representative Seed-word: \u0026ldquo;innovative\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;As a marketing representative, generate an informative, persuasive product description that highlights the innovative features of the new smartphone. The smartphone has the following features [insert your features]” In this example, the instruction prompting is used to ensure that the product description is informative and persuasive. The role prompting is used to ensure that the description is written from the perspective of a marketing representative. And the seed-word prompting is used to ensure that the description focuses on the innovative features of the smartphone.\nChapter 4: Standard Prompts Standard prompts are a simple way to guide the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific task for the model to complete.\nFor example, if you want to generate a summary of a news article, you would provide a task such as \u0026ldquo;summarize this news article\u0026rdquo;.\nPrompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a [task]\u0026rdquo;\nExamples\nGenerating a summary of a news article: Task: Summarize this news article Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a summary of this news article\u0026rdquo; Generating a product review: Task: Write a review of a new smartphone Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a review of this new smartphone\u0026rdquo; Also, Standard prompts can be combined with other techniques like role prompting and seed-word prompting to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\nStandard prompts, Role prompting, and Seed-word prompting techniques combined: Task: Generate a product review for a new laptop Instructions: The review should be objective, informative and highlight the unique features of the laptop Role: Tech expert Seed-word: \u0026ldquo;powerful\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;As a tech expert, generate an objective and informative product review that highlights the powerful features of the new laptop.\u0026rdquo; In this example, the standard prompts technique is used to ensure that the model generates a product review. The role prompting is used to ensure that the review is written from the perspective of a tech expert. And the seedword prompting is used to ensure that the review focuses on the powerful features of the laptop.\nChapter 5: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting are techniques used to generate text from ChatGPT with minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data available for a specific task or when the task is new and not well-defined.\nThe zero-shot prompting technique is used when there are no examples available for the task. The model is provided with a general task and it generates text based on its understanding of the task.\nThe one-shot prompting technique is used when there is only one example available for the task. The model is provided with the example and generates text based on its understanding of the example.\nThe few-shot prompting technique is used when there are a limited number of examples available for the task. The model is provided with the examples and generates text based on its understanding of the examples.\nPrompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate text based on [number] examples\u0026rdquo;\nExamples\nGenerating a product description for a new product with no examples available: Task: Write a product description for a new smartwatch Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a product description for this new smartwatch with zero examples\u0026rdquo; Generating a product comparison with one example available: Task: Compare a new smartphone to the latest iPhone Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a product comparison of this new smartphone with one example (latest iPhone)\u0026rdquo; Generating a product review with few examples available: Task: Write a review of a new e-reader Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a review of this new e-reader with few examples (3 other e-readers)\u0026rdquo; These techniques can be used to generate text based on a model\u0026rsquo;s understanding of the task or examples provided.\nChapter 6: \u0026ldquo;Let’s think about this” prompt The \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this\u0026rdquo; prompt is a technique used to encourage ChatGPT to generate text that is reflective and contemplative. This technique is useful for tasks such as writing essays, poetry, or creative writing.\nThe prompt formula for the \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this\u0026rdquo; prompt is simply the phrase \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this\u0026rdquo; followed by a topic or question.\nExamples\nGenerating a reflective essay: Task: Write a reflective essay on the topic of personal growth Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this: personal growth\u0026rdquo; Generating a poem: Task: Write a poem about the changing seasons Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about this: the changing seasons\u0026rdquo; This prompt is asking for a conversation or discussion about a specific topic or idea. The speaker is inviting ChatGPT to engage in a dialogue about the subject at hand.\nThe model is provided with a prompt, which serves as the starting point for the conversation or text generation.\nThe model then uses its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt. This technique allows ChatGPT to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text based on the provided prompt.\nTo use the \u0026quot;Let’s think about this prompt\u0026quot; technique with ChatGPT, you can follow these steps:\nIdentify the topic or idea you want to discuss. Formulate a prompt that clearly states the topic or idea, and starts the conversation or text generation. Preface the prompt with \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss\u0026rdquo; to indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re initiating a conversation or discussion. Examples\nPrompt: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s think about the impact of climate change on agriculture\u0026rdquo;\nPrompt: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss the current state of artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo;\nPrompt: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work\u0026rdquo;\nYou can also add a open-ended question, statement or a piece of text that you want the model to continue or build upon.\nOnce you provide the prompt, the model will use its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt and will continue the conversation in a coherent way.\nThis unique prompt helps ChatGPT to give answers in different perspectives and angles, resulting in more dynamic and informative passages.\nThe steps to use the prompt are simple and easy to follow, and it can truly make a difference in your writing. Give it a try and see for yourself.\nChapter 7: Self-Consistency Prompt The Self-Consistency prompt is a technique used to ensure that the output of ChatGPT is consistent with the input provided. This technique is useful for tasks such as fact-checking, data validation, or consistency checking in text generation.\nThe prompt formula for the Self-Consistency prompt is the input text followed by the instruction \u0026ldquo;Please ensure the following text is self-consistent\u0026rdquo;\nAlternatively, the model can be prompted to generate text that is consistent with the provided input.\nExamples\nText Generation Task: Generate a product review Instructions: The review should be consistent with the product information provided in the input Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a product review that is consistent with the following product information [insert product information]\u0026rdquo; Text Summarization Task: Summarize a news article Instructions: The summary should be consistent with the information provided in the article Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Summarize the following news article in a way that is consistent with the information provided [insert news article]\u0026rdquo; Text Completion Task: Complete a sentence Instructions: The completion should be consistent with the context provided in the input Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Complete the following sentence in a way that is consistent with the context provided [insert sentence]\u0026rdquo; Fact-checking Task: Check for consistency in a given news article Input text: \u0026ldquo;The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Please ensure the following text is selfconsistent: The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.\u0026rdquo; Data validation Task: Check for consistency in a given data set Input text: \u0026ldquo;The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Please ensure the following text is selfconsistent: The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.\u0026rdquo; Chapter 8: Seed-word Prompt The Seed-word prompt is a technique used to control the output of ChatGPT by providing it with a specific seed-word or phrase.\nThe prompt formula for the Seed-word prompt is the seed-word or phrase followed by the instruction \u0026ldquo;Please generate text based on the following seed-word\u0026rdquo;\nExamples\nText generation: Task: Generate a story about a dragon Seed-word: \u0026ldquo;Dragon\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Please generate text based on the following seed-word: Dragon\u0026rdquo; Language Translation: Task: Translate a sentence from English to Spanish Seed-word: \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo; Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Please generate text based on the following seed-word: Hello\u0026rdquo; This technique allows the model to generate text that is related to the seed word and expand on it. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to control the model\u0026rsquo;s generated text to be related to a certain topic or context. The Seed-word prompt can be combined with role prompting and instruction prompting to create more specific and targeted generated text. By providing a seed word or phrase, the model can generate text that is related to that seed word or phrase and by providing information about the desired output and role, the model can generate text in a specific style or tone that is consistent with the role or instructions. This allows for more control over the generated text and can be useful for a wide range of applications\nExamples\nText Generation Task: Generate a poem Instructions: The poem should be related to the seed word \u0026ldquo;love\u0026rdquo; and should be written in the style of a sonnet. Role: Poet Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a sonnet related to the seed word \u0026rsquo;love\u0026rsquo; as a poet\u0026rdquo; Text Completion Task: Complete a sentence Instructions: The completion should be related to the seed word \u0026ldquo;science\u0026rdquo; and should be written in the style of a research paper Role: Researcher Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Complete the following sentence in a way that is related to the seed word \u0026lsquo;science\u0026rsquo; and in the style of a research paper as a researcher: [insert sentence]\u0026rdquo; Text Summarization Task: Summarize a news article Instructions: The summary should be related to the seed word \u0026ldquo;politics\u0026rdquo; and should be written in a neutral and unbiased tone Role: Journalist Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Summarize the following news article in a way that is related to the seed word \u0026lsquo;politics\u0026rsquo; in a neutral and unbiased tone as a journalist: [insert news article]\u0026rdquo; Chapter 9: Knowledge Generation prompt The Knowledge Generation prompt is a technique used to elicit new and original information from ChatGPT. The prompt formula for the Knowledge Generation prompt is \u0026ldquo;Please generate new and original information about X\u0026rdquo; where X is the topic of interest. This is a technique that uses a model\u0026rsquo;s pre-existing knowledge to generate new information or to answer a question. To use this prompt with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a question or topic as input, along with a prompt that specifies the task or goal for the generated text. The prompt should include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\nExamples\nKnowledge Generation Task: Generate new information about a specific topic Instructions: The generated information should be accurate and relevant to the topic Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate new and accurate information about [specific topic] \u0026quot; Question Answering Task: Answer a question Instructions: The answer should be accurate and relevant to the question Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Answer the following question: [insert question]\u0026rdquo; Knowledge Integration Task: Integrate new information with the existing knowledge Instructions: The integration should be accurate and relevant to the topic Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Integrate the following information with the existing knowledge about [specific topic]: [insert new information]\u0026rdquo; Data Analysis Task: Generate insights about customer behavior from a given dataset Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Please generate new and original information about customer behavior from this dataset\u0026rdquo; Chapter 10: Knowledge Integration prompts This technique uses a model\u0026rsquo;s pre-existing knowledge to integrate new information or to connect different pieces of information.\nThis technique is useful for combining existing knowledge with new information to generate a more comprehensive understanding of a specific topic.\nThe model should be provided with a new information and the existing knowledge as input, along with a prompt that specifies the task or goal for the generated text. The prompt should include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\nExamples\nKnowledge Integration Task: Integrate new information with the existing knowledge Instructions: The integration should be accurate and relevant to the topic Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Integrate the following information with the existing knowledge about [specific topic]: [insert new information]\u0026rdquo; Connecting pieces of information Task: Connect different pieces of information Instructions: The connections should be relevant and logical Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Connect the following pieces of information in a way that is relevant and logical: [insert information 1] [insert information 2]\u0026rdquo; Updating existing knowledge Task: Update existing knowledge with new information Instructions: The updated information should be accurate and relevant Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Update the existing knowledge about [specific topic] with the following information: [insert new information] Chapter 11: Multiple Choice prompts This technique presents a model with a question or task and a set of predefined options as potential answers. This technique is useful for generating text that is limited to a specific set of options and can be used for question-answering, text completion and other tasks. The model can generate text that is limited to the predefined options.\nTo use the multiple-choice prompt with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a question or task as input, along with a set of predefined options as potential answers. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\nQuestion Answering Task: Answer a multiple-choice question Instructions: The answer should be one of the predefined options Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Answer the following question by selecting one of the following options: [insert question] [insert option 1] [insert option 2] [insert option 3]\u0026rdquo; Text completion Task: Complete a sentence with one of the predefined options Instructions: The completion should be one of the predefined options Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Complete the following sentence by selecting one of the following options: [insert sentence] [insert option 1] [insert option 2] [insert option 3]\u0026rdquo; Sentiment analysis Task: Classify a text as positive, neutral or negative Instructions: The classification should be one of the predefined options Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Classify the following text as positive, neutral or negative by selecting one of the following options: [insert text] [positive] [neutral] [negative]\u0026rdquo; Chapter 12: Interpretable Soft Prompts Interpretable soft prompts is a technique that allows to control the model\u0026rsquo;s generated text while providing some flexibility to the model.\nIt is done by providing the model with a set of controlled inputs and some additional information about the desired output. This technique allows for more interpretable and controllable generated text. Examples\nText generation Task: Generate a story Instructions: The story should be based on a given set of characters and a specific theme Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate a story based on the following characters: [insert characters] and the theme: [insert theme]\u0026rdquo; Text completion Task: Complete a sentence Instructions: The completion should be in the style of a specific author Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Complete the following sentence in the style of [specific author]: [insert sentence]\u0026rdquo; Language modeling Task: Generate text in a specific style Instructions: The text should be in the style of a specific period Prompt formula: \u0026ldquo;Generate text in the style of [specific period]: [insert context]\u0026rdquo; ","date":"2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","image":"/post/ChatGPTPrompt/beginnerStart.png","permalink":"/p/art-of-asking-chatgpt/","title":"Art of Asking ChatGPT"},{"content":"📚 Online Resources Emoji Emoji\nComprehensive Emoji dictionary\nCivitAI CivitAI\nCivitai is a platform that makes it easy for people to share and discover resources for creating AI art.\nHugging Face Hugging Face\nThe AI community.
