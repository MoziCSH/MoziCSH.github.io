This book is a comprehensive guide designed to help you understand and utilize various prompting techniques in order to get high quality answers from ChatGPT. The book uses easy-to-understand language to explain and is supplemented by examples and formulas for questioning techniques. Learn how to use prompting techniques to control the output of ChatGPT and make it produce text the way you want. Examples are provided of how to use a combination of different prompting techniques to achieve a specific purpose. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) 第一章: 提示工程技术简介 (Introduction to Prompt Engineering Techniques) ❓什么是提示工程？\n\u0026ldquo;提示工程\u0026quot;是创建提示、要求或指示的过程，用来引导ChatGPT等语言模型的输出。它允许用户控制模型的输出，生成符合他们特定需求的文本。\nChatGPT是一种最先进的语言模型，能够生成类似人类的文本。它建立在transformer 架构上，这使它能够处理大量的数据并生成高质量的文本。\n提示允许用户控制模型的输出，生成相关、准确和高质量的文本。\n该模型能够生成类似人类的文本，但如果没有适当的引导，它输出的内容，可能不是我们所期望的。\n这就是提示工程的用武之地：通过提供清晰而具体的说明，您可以指导模型输出，确保它是相关的。\n提示公式是提示的具体格式，它一般由3个要素组成:\n任务：对模型生成内容的清晰、简洁的陈述。\n说明：模型生成文本时应遵循的指令。\n角色：模型在生成文本时应承担的角色。\n第二章：说明提示技术（Instructions Prompt Technique）. 现在，让我们开始探索 “说明提示技术”，以及如何用它来从ChatGPT生成高质量的文本。\n\u0026ldquo;说明提示技术\u0026quot;是一种指导ChatGPT输出的方法，它为模型提供具体的指令。这种技术在确保输出内容的相关性、和高质量方面，非常有用。\n要使用说明提示技术，你需要为模型提供一个清晰简明的任务，和可以遵循的具体指令。\n举个例子，假如你要生成客服的回答。首先要提供一个任务，如“生成客户咨询的回复（generate responses to customer inquiries）”，以及说明：回答应该是专业的并提供准确的信息（responses should be professional and provide accurate information）\n提示（Prompt）公式：”按照这些指示生成[任务]：[说明]”\n生成客服回复:\n任务：生成对客户咨询的回复（Generate responses to customer inquiries） 说明：回答应该是专业的并提供准确的信息（responses should be professional and provide accurate information） 提示（Prompt）公式：“生成对客户咨询的回复：回答应该是专业的并提供准确的信息” （Generate professional and accurate responses to customer inquiries following these instructions: The responses should be professional and provide accurate information） 生成一份法律文件：\n任务：生成一份法律文件 说明：该文件应符合相关法律和法规的规定 提示（Prompt）公式：”按照这些指令，生成一份符合相关法律和法规的法律文件：该文件应符合相关法律和法规。” （Generate a legal document that is compliant with relevant laws and regulations following these instructions: The document should be in compliance with relevant laws and regulations） 在使用指令提示技术时，重点是：指令应该是清晰、具体的。\n这将会确保输出内容具有相关性、和高质量。指令提示技术可以和下一章中将解释的 “角色提示 “和 “种子词提示 “结合起来，提高ChatGPT的输出质量。\n第三章：角色提示（role prompting technique） ","date":"2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","image":"/post/ChatGPTPrompt/beginnerStart.png","permalink":"/p/art-of-asking-chatgpt/","title":"Art of Asking ChatGPT"},{"content":"📚 Online Resources Emoji Emoji\nComprehensive Emoji dictionary\nCivitAI CivitAI\nCivitai is a platform that makes it easy for people to share and discover resources for creating AI art.\nHugging Face Hugging Face\nThe AI community.
